This is the repository for the [BALI: Enhancing Biomedical Language Representations through Knowledge Graph and Language Model Alignment](https://doi.org/10.1145/3726302.3729901) accepted to [SIGIR 2025](https://sigir2025.dei.unipd.it/accepted-papers.html). The paper proposes a novel joint pre-training method that enhances biomedical language models with the information UMLS large biomedical Knowledge Graph (KG) through text-KG representation alignment.
